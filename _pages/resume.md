Significant experience in developing **numerical codes for a broad array of
physics/engineering problems** and **machine learning (ML) / uncertainty quantification (UQ) tools**

* Development of **neural network-based surrogate models** and **physics-informed ML** approaches for accelerating materials discovery and design of energy storage devices such as Li-Ion batteries and supercapacitors.
* Design and implementation of **novel Monte Carlo-based solvers** to accelerate predictive modeling/UQ for multiphase flows in reactive granular media and subsurface phenomena.
* Development of numerical solvers for a broad range of **nonlinear systems with inherent uncertainty or random forcing**.
* Construction of **innovative models for shocked particle-laden flows** that enable process-scale, predictive simulations of high-speed applications ranging from dust explosions to engines for hypersonic propulsion systems.

## Professional experience

### [DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESOURCES ENGINEERING](https://earth.stanford.edu/ere), [STANFORD UNIVERSITY](https://www.stanford.edu) - Stanford, CA, USA

* Position: **Postdoctoral Scholar**, September 2018-Present
* Duties: 
  * Development of **enhanced multilevel Monte Carlo** methods for estimating the 
    cumulative distribution function of quantities of interest in **multiphase flows** e.g. in stochastic reservoir simulation: 
    * Fusion of standard Monte Carlo with **variance reduction** techniques to 
      **speed up UQ** simulations.
    * Sponsored by Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) and Total
      S.A. and aimed at **inventing, testing and deploying new UQ techniques** that are more computationally efficient and yet as accurate as current exhaustive system realizations.
  * Design of a **neural network** with **TensorFlow 2** to accelerate **sensitivity analysis** and **UQ** studies of **energy storage systems** to aid in the **design** and testing of these devices.
     
### [SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOUNDATION](https://www.foundation.sdsu.edu/) - San Diego, CA, USA

    of **particle-laden flows** in high-speed engineering applications:
    * Design and validation of **Cloud-In-Cell** models with enhanced accuracy and efficiency compared to the current state of the art for simulation of a particle cloud interacting with a shocked carrier flow.
    * Multi-institution collaborative effort aimed at designing a general **multiscale framework** for modeling **multimaterial dynamics**.
    * Sponsored by Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) and aimed 
      at designing and implementing computational models capable of **predicting** the dynamics of **process-scale, compressible particle-laden flow** problems with **uncertain parameters**.
