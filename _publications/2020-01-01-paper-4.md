## Abstract

The timely completion of design cycles for multiscale and multiphysics systems ranging from consumerelectronics to hypersonic vehicles has become increasingly reliant on rapid simulation-based prototyping.Delivering optimal and robust designs requires implementing complex multiphysics models and analyzing theimpact of large spaces of possibly correlated control variables (CVs) on quantities of interest (QoIs) withnon-Gaussian and/or multimodal distributions. We develop a model-agnostic, moment-independent globalsensitivity analysis (GSA) that ranks the effects of CVs on QoIs via the information-theoretic approachof differential mutual information. To rank CVs with confidence, we leverage big data cheaply generatedby a deep neural network (DNN) surrogate model, whose predictions, conversely, are made explainable bythe GSA so that the DNN can be deployed to close design loops.  We test this framework on a testbedrelevant to multiscale supercapacitor design, utilizing a recently developed domain-aware Graph-InformedNeural Network (GINN). We show that GINN-based CV rankings are better resolved than their counterpartsobtained with a physics-based model for a fixed computational budget, and that our information-theoreticGSA can accelerate product prototyping by identifying the most and least sensitive input directions andperforming subsequent design iterations over appropriately reduced parameter subspaces.--->
