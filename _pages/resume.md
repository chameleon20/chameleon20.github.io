## Main Accomplishments

Significant experience in developing **numerical codes** for a broad array of **physics/engineering problems** and **deep learning (DL) / uncertainty quantification (UQ) tools**

* Development of a computationally efficient **Python framework** to predict **$\mathrm{CO}_2$-injection induced seismicity** using **multifidelity Monte Carlo** and **graph neural networks (GNNs)**. 
* Development of a **finite-element based method** to compute the damping rate of **fluid oscillations in microfluidic nozzles** that is orders of magnitude faster than computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. 
* Contribution to design and testing of a novel computational model for simulation of compressible flows involving shocks and contact discontinuities using a **localized artificial diffusivity (LAD)** approach.
* Use of **operator learning** to predict initial-to-final state mapping of droplet deposition in a moving subdomain approach for generating **3D printed parts** in order to accelerate part-level quality prediction.
* Construction of **surrogate models** based on **physics-informed machine learning (ML)** and **deep neural networks** for accelerating the discovery of novel materials and the design of energy storage devices such as Li-Ion batteries and supercapacitors.
* Design and implementation of **novel Monte Carlo-based solvers** to accelerate predictive modeling/UQ for multiphase flows in subsurface phenomena.
* Development of numerical solvers for a wide range of **nonlinear systems with inherent uncertainty or random forcing**.
* Construction of **innovative models for shocked particle-laden flows** that enable process-scale, predictive simulations of high-speed applications ranging from dust explosions to engines for hypersonic propulsion systems.
