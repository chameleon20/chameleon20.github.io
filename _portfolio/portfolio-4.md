title: "Two-way coupled Cloud-In-Cell modeling of non-isothermal particle-laden flows: a Subgrid Particle-Averaged Reynolds Stress-Equivalent (SPARSE) formulation"
excerpt: "Together with Gustaaf Jacobs and H.S. Udaykumar, at [San Diego State University](https://www.sdsu.edu/) I worked on developing a two-way coupled Cloud-In-Cell (CIC) formulation for particle-laden flows that accounts for cloud size and subgrid-scale stresses using averaging techniques, and for cloud deformation using methods from continuum mechanics. It traces a physical cloud of particles as a point and distributes its influence on the carrier flow via a multivariate Gaussian distribution function.<br/><img src='/images/Gaussians.png'>"
