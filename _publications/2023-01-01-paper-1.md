## Abstract

A major challenge in developing accurate and robust numerical solutions to multi-physics problems is to deal with evolving discontinuities in field quantities. The problem-specific nature of such discontinuities has led to a plethora of bespoke discretization schemes and platform-dependent implementations using targeted numerical treatments near discontinuities. Developing such schemes and implementations takes decades of research, tens of millions of dollars, and significant level of effort (LoE) by computational and domain experts in their respective communities. We introduce the paradigm of "inverse asymptotic treatment" (IAT) of discontinuities in fluid flows through modification of the governing partial differential equations (PDEs). These modifications, applied at a semantic and platform-independent level, enable using standard numerical schemes to discretize and integrate the modified PDEs, making them more directly computable and yielding orders of magnitude reduction in cost and LoE via automation. We outline IAT for phase-field modeling of two-phase incompressible flows, but to showcase its generality, we deploy it for single-phase compressible flows, involving shock and contact discontinuities, as localized artificial diffusivity (LAD) methods. Using canonical problems, we show that traditional LAD allows standard non-dissipative schemes but requires free-parameter tuning. Nevertheless, its application to a laminar hypersonic compression corner shows IAT's ability to, within just a few months, rapidly prototype solvers whose performance and predictive capacity comes close to state-of-the-art bespoke schemes developed and optimized over years or even decades. Finally, we propose a novel LAD approach via "reverse-engineered", TVD-inspired PDE modifications that, when combined with second-order central differencing, is robust, accurate, and free of problem-dependent tuning.
