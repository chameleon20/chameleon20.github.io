title: "Accelerating Part-Scale Simulation in Liquid Metal Jet Additive Manufacturing via Operator Learning"
excerpt: "Together with Svyatoslav Korneev, Kyle Pietrzyk and Morad Behandish, at [PARC, a Xerox Company](https://www.parc.com/) I worked on developing an approach for speeding up quality prediction for 3D printed parts generated through liquid metal jetting by using operator learning to predict the mapping between initial and final states of droplet depositions in a moving subdomain approach.<br/><img src='/images/moving_subdomain.png'>"
