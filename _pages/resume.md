## Main accomplishments

Significant experience in developing **numerical codes** for a broad array of
**physics/engineering problems** and **deep learning (DL) / uncertainty quantification (UQ) tools**

* Construction of **surrogate models** based on **physics-informed machine learning (ML)** and **deep neural networks (DNNs)** for accelerating the discovery 
of novel materials and the design of energy storage devices such as Li-Ion batteries and supercapacitors.
* Design and implementation of **novel Monte Carlo-based solvers** to accelerate predictive modeling/UQ for multiphase flows in subsurface phenomena.
* Development of numerical solvers for a wide range of **nonlinear systems with inherent uncertainty or random forcing**.
* Construction of **innovative models for shocked particle-laden flows** that enable process-scale, predictive simulations of high-speed applications ranging from dust explosions to engines for hypersonic propulsion systems.

## Current employment

### [DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESOURCES ENGINEERING](https://earth.stanford.edu/ere), [STANFORD UNIVERSITY](https://www.stanford.edu) - Stanford, CA, USA

* Position: **Postdoctoral Scholar**, September 2018-Present
* Duties: 
  * Development of **enhanced multilevel Monte Carlo** methods for accelerating the estimation of **cumulative distribution functions** of quantities of interest in **multiphase flows** e.g. in stochastic reservoir simulation: 
    * Fusion of standard Monte Carlo with **variance reduction** techniques to 
      **speed up UQ** simulations.
    * Sponsored by Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) and Total
      S.A. and aimed at **inventing, testing and deploying new UQ techniques** that are more computationally efficient and yet as accurate as current exhaustive system realizations.
  * Design of a **DNN** with **TensorFlow 2** to accelerate **sensitivity analysis** and **UQ** studies of energy storage systems to enable **rapid prototyping** in the design of these devices.
