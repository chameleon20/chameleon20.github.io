Significant experience in developing state-of-the-art numerical codes and machine learning (ML) / uncertainty quantification (UQ) tools

* Development of neural network-based surrogate models and physics-informed ML approaches for accelerating materials discovery and design of energy storage devices such as Li-Ion batteries and supercapacitors.
* Design and implementation of novel Monte Carlo-based solvers to accelerate predictive modeling/UQ for multiphase flows in reactive granular media and subsurface phenomena.
* Development of numerical solvers for a broad range of nonlinear systems with inherent uncertainty or random forcing.
* Construction of innovative models for shocked particle-laden flows that enable process-scale, predictive simulations of high-speed applications ranging from dust explosions to engines for hypersonic propulsion systems.
